# Rbabikerentals.com Product Requirements Document (Phase 1)

## 1. Product Summary
Rbabikerentals.com is a web-first bike rental platform with three role experiences in one product:
- `customer`
- `partner_investor`
- `admin`

Phase 1 goal is to launch end-to-end booking and operations for bikes/scooters with strong policy transparency, KYC-first onboarding, and partner/admin operational control.

This PRD uses Selfspin-like feature coverage as a baseline reference (location-based booking flow, policy pages, coupons, partner/invest hooks), but not Selfspin UI design.

## 2. Scope and Defaults
- Build scope: web-first only (no native mobile app in Phase 1).
- Role model: partner and investor are the same role in Phase 1 (`partner_investor`).
- KYC model: Aadhaar + Driving Licence via Setu DigiLocker; manual-review fallback by admin.
- CIBIL: not a hard auto-block in Phase 1. Used as manual-review signal only.
- Geography: Bengaluru-only in Phase 1 (all customer bookings, fleet operations, and admin operations scoped to Bengaluru).
