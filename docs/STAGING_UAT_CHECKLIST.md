   - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_DB_URL`

   - `JOB_SECRET`
2. Set `ALLOW_DEV_HEADERS=false` in staging.
3. Set `APP_ENV=production` in staging-like validation environments that are meant to mirror production behavior.

## 2) Database Setup
1. Run migration:
   - `npm run migrate`
2. Run seed:
   - `npm run seed`
3. Validate RLS:
   - customer reads own bookings only
   - partner reads only owned-vehicle bookings
   - admin has full operational visibility

## 3) Payment Validation
1. Create booking in `payment_pending`.
2. Create Razorpay order via `/api/payments/order`.
3. Re-hit `/api/payments/order` for the same booking and confirm the existing open order is reused.
4. Confirm a customer cannot create a payment order for another customer booking.
5. Trigger webhook test event to `/api/webhooks/razorpay`.
6. Confirm booking moves to `confirmed` on `payment.captured`.

## 4) KYC Validation
1. Start KYC: `/api/kyc/digilocker/start`.
2. Validate callback handling: `/api/kyc/digilocker/callback` with correct `x-setu-webhook-secret`.
3. Validate callback rejection with an invalid or missing webhook secret.
4. Validate status polling: `/api/kyc/digilocker/status/[requestId]`.
5. Confirm a customer cannot poll another user's KYC request.
6. Validate admin queue and approve/reject:
   - `/api/admin/kyc/manual-review`
   - `/api/admin/kyc/[userId]/approve`
   - `/api/admin/kyc/[userId]/reject`

## 4.1) Booking integrity validation
1. Create a booking with a valid duration window for the selected plan.
2. Attempt a booking where `duration_bucket` does not match the actual pickup/drop window and confirm API returns `400 duration_window_mismatch`.
3. Attempt two overlapping bookings for the same vehicle and confirm one is rejected.
4. Attempt an overlapping extension on the same vehicle and confirm it is rejected.

## 5) Operational Job Validation
1. Run document expiry job:
   - `npm run job:documents`
2. Run incident escalation job:
   - `npm run job:incidents`
3. Validate notifications queued in `notification_jobs`.

## 6) Live Tracking Validation
1. Trigger vehicle GPS update ping:
   - `POST /api/internal/tracking/update` with `x-job-secret`.
2. Validate partner tracking visibility:
   - `GET /api/partner/tracking` returns only partner-owned vehicles.
3. Validate admin tracking visibility:
   - `GET /api/admin/tracking` returns all tracked vehicles.
4. Validate dashboard map rendering:
   - Partner page (`/partner`) shows fleet-only map markers.
   - Admin page (`/admin`) shows platform tracking.

## 7) UI UAT Flows
1. Customer dashboard:
   - Quote -> booking -> list bookings -> damage report.
2. Partner dashboard:
   - Revenue view -> tracking map -> block vehicle window.
3. Admin dashboard:
   - Fleet ops: add/edit/deactivate/delete vehicles.
   - Fleet ops: upload/remove vehicle images.
   - View bookings -> reject booking.
   - View KYC queue -> approve/reject entries.
   - Monitor live fleet locations.

## 8) Release Sign-Off
1. `npm run typecheck` passes.
2. `npm run test` passes.
3. `npm run build` passes.
4. Business owner confirms payment + KYC credentials are production-approved.
5. `npm audit` shows no unresolved production-blocking auth/payment vulnerabilities.
6. Bengaluru UAT approval received before production release.
